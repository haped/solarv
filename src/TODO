solarv TODO


  * implement a full light-time abberation correction
  * cleanup our temporary station body codes -- need to use id from the private pool for these
  * compute the j2000 state of observer, sun and target, and include
    these in the output ephemeris
  * remove need for a prepared kernel to specify the observer location
  * re-enable fits mode, so that the full set of available data can be stored
    in a fits table

DONE

  * in soleph_t, store all members in native spice units
